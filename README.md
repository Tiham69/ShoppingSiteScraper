# ShoppingSiteScraper
This code used some simple python library to scrape a choiced shopping website and then gets the products name and price and checks daily for any change. If the price drops the program sends an email about it in any day but if the price is unchanged or incresed.

For now it only gets info of one single product and the price but with some simple modification it can be adjusted to get information about more than one item. However, do check the site response and if the site itself allows you to do it or not.
